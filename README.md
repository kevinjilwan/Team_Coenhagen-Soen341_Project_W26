## Project Description

MealMajor is a web app created to help students plan their meals and stay organized with their food choices throughout the week. 
Users will be able to create an account, log in, and manage their personal profile (dietary preferences, allergies,etc.). This ensures every users
gets an experience tailored to their needs and wants. The app also includes a recipe management system where users can create, edit, delete, search, 
and filter recipes based on factors like time, difficulty, cost, and dietary needs. Furthermore, MealMajor offers a weekly meal planner displayed in a simple grid 
where users can assign recipes to specific days and meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack), update plans easily, and prevent repetition of meals within the same week.
